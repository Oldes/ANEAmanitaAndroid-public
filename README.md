Android Native Extension in 4 steps (including test app)
------------------------

Requirements:

1. AIR SDK http://www.adobe.com/devnet/air/air-sdk-download.html
2. Android Studio https://developer.android.com/studio/

Script goall.bat will do everything including building and running test if some device is connected.
The only thing which is not made using this script is *making an Android project* which must be done from Android Studio as I don't know, how to update it from a script so far.

Thanks belongs to MyFlashLabs Team for this tutorial which could be also handed: http://www.myflashlabs.com/build-ane-android-studio/
